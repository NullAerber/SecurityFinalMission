 abstract={In many real world applications,such as sensor network,market analysis and medical diagnosis,uncertain data with PU-learning scenarios are common in emerging applications.Based on the information gain algorithm in POSC45 and considering the uncertain data interval and probability distribution proposed in UDT,this paper proposes a decision tree algorithm DTU-PU(Decision Tree for Uncertain data with PU-learning),which can handle uncertain data with uncertain numerical attribute.Experimental results on UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has good classification accuracy and it is robust against data uncertainty.},

 abstract={This paper aimed at promoting the method of content-filtering for information push. It focused on researching the method of finding negative examples based on the traditional positive and unlabeled examples learning theory. At last it took an experiment on text categorization. The experiment shows that this method is ideal for precision and speed of content filtering.},
